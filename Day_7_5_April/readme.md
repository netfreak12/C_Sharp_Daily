## Introduction

Loops are fundamental constructs in programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. This program explores the four main types of loops in C# and demonstrates their syntax and behavior with examples.

---

## Types of Loops

### 1. While Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. It can run in both forward (increment) and backward (decrement) directions.

#### Example:
```csharp
int i = 1; // Initialization

while (i <= 10) // Condition
{
    Console.WriteLine(i); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    i++; // Increment
}
```

#### Key Points:
- Requires initialization, condition, and increment.
- Executes zero or more times depending on the condition.

---

### 2. For Loop

The `for` loop is a compact way to iterate over a range of values. It combines initialization, condition, and increment in a single line.

#### Example:
```csharp
for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i); // Output: 1 2 3 ... 20
}
```

#### Key Points:
- Ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations is known beforehand.
- Combines all three steps (initialization, condition, increment) in one line.

---

### 3. Foreach Loop

The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over elements in a collection (e.g., arrays, lists). It automatically handles initialization, condition, and increment internally.

#### Example:
```csharp
int[] ar = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
foreach (int i in ar)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6
}
```

#### Key Points:
- Cannot run in reverse (backward direction).
- No need to manually manage initialization, condition, or increment.

---

### 4. Do-While Loop

The `do-while` loop ensures that the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is false initially. It can run in both forward and backward directions.

#### Example:
```csharp
int i = 1;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(i); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    i++;
} while (i <= 10);
```

#### Key Points:
- Executes the block of code first, then checks the condition.
- Ensures at least one execution regardless of the condition.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/netfreak12/C_Sharp_Daily.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).

3. Navigate to the `Program.cs` file under the `Day_7_5_April` namespace.

4. Uncomment the loop example you want to test and run the program.

5. Observe the output in the console.
