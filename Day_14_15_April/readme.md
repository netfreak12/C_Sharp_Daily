## Encapsulation

### **Read-Only Properties**
Encapsulation is one of the core principles of OOP, ensuring that data is accessed and modified in a controlled manner. In the provided code, **read-only properties** are used to expose values while preventing them from being modified after initialization.

#### Code Example:
```csharp
public class Math
{
    private int _length;
    private int _width;

    public Math(int l, int w)
    {
        _length = l;
        _width = w;
    }

    public int MyProperty
    {
        get { return _length * _width; }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The `MyProperty` property is read-only because it only has a `get` accessor.
- It calculates and returns the product of `_length` and `_width`.
- Since there is no `set` accessor, the value of `MyProperty` cannot be modified externally.

#### Use Case:
- Useful when you want to expose derived or computed values without allowing external modification.
- For example, exposing the area of a rectangle (`_length * _width`) as a read-only property ensures that the calculation logic remains encapsulated.

---

### **Validation in Properties**
Properties can also include validation logic to ensure that only valid data is assigned to private fields.

#### Code Example:
```csharp
public class Math
{
    private string _name;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return _name; }
        private set
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value))
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("Name cannot be null or empty.");
            }
            _name = value;
        }
    }

    public Math(string name)
    {
        Name = name; // Uses the property to enforce validation
    }

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name is: {Name}");
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The `Name` property includes a `private set` accessor with validation logic.
- If an invalid value (e.g., an empty string) is passed, an exception is thrown.
- This ensures that the `_name` field always holds valid data.

#### Use Case:
- Ensures data integrity by validating inputs before assigning them to private fields.
- For example, validating user input for names, email addresses, or other critical data fields.

## Polymorphism

### **Method Overriding**
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. In the provided code, **method overriding** is demonstrated using the `virtual` and `override` keywords.

#### Code Example:
```csharp
public class Bike
{
    public virtual void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bike is starting...");
    }
}

public class Car : Bike
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is starting...");
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The `Start` method in the `Bike` class is marked as `virtual`, allowing it to be overridden in derived classes.
- The `Car` class overrides the `Start` method using the `override` keyword.
- When calling `Start` on an object of type `Car`, the overridden implementation in the `Car` class is executed.

#### Use Case:
- Allows derived classes to provide specific implementations of methods defined in a base class.
- For example, defining a generic `Start` method in a `Vehicle` base class and providing specific implementations for `Car`, `Bike`, etc.

---

### **Virtual and Override Keywords**
The `virtual` keyword allows a method to be overridden in derived classes, while the `override` keyword specifies the new implementation.

#### Key Points:
- Without `virtual`, a method cannot be overridden.
- The `override` keyword ensures that the derived class provides a new implementation of the method.

---

## Inheritance

### **Base and Derived Classes**
Inheritance allows a class (derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (base class).

#### Code Example:
```csharp
public class Car : Bike
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is starting...");
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The `Car` class inherits from the `Bike` class.
- It overrides the `Start` method to provide its own implementation.

#### Use Case:
- Promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes.
- For example, creating a hierarchy of vehicles where `Car`, `Bike`, and `Truck` inherit from a common `Vehicle` base class.

---

## Method Overloading vs Method Overriding

### **Method Overloading**
Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.

#### Example:
```csharp
public void Display(int value) { ... }
public void Display(string message) { ... }
```

#### Key Points:
- Resolved at compile-time.
- Differentiated by parameter types or number of parameters.

### **Method Overriding**
Method overriding allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a method defined in the base class.

#### Example:
```csharp
public virtual void Start() { ... } // Base class
public override void Start() { ... } // Derived class
```

#### Key Points:
- Resolved at runtime.
- Requires the base class method to be marked as `virtual`.

## Error Handling

### **Exception Handling with `try-catch`**
The `try-catch` block is used to handle exceptions gracefully.

#### Code Example:
```csharp
try
{
    Math math = new Math(""); // Invalid name (empty string)
    math.Display();
}
catch (ArgumentException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
}
```

#### Explanation:
- If an invalid name is passed to the `Math` constructor, an `ArgumentException` is thrown.
- The `catch` block catches the exception and displays an error message.

#### Use Case:
- Prevents the program from crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- Provides meaningful error messages to users.

---

## Use Cases

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - Exposing calculated values (e.g., area, perimeter) as read-only properties.
   - Validating user input before assigning it to private fields.

2. **Polymorphism**:
   - Defining a generic behavior in a base class and providing specific implementations in derived classes.
   - For example, implementing different behaviors for `Start` methods in `Car` and `Bike`.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - Creating a hierarchy of related classes (e.g., `Vehicle`, `Car`, `Bike`).
   - Reusing common functionality across derived classes.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handling invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios gracefully.
   - Providing user-friendly error messages.
